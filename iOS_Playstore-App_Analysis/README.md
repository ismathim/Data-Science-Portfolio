# iOS-GooglePlay-App-Analysis

Hello Fellow Techiast!

This is my First Project in Data science.

(Taking an Hypothetical Situation)
Working as a Data Analyst in a company which deals with Developing Apps, I'm expected to come Up with the best App Idea by going through the Datasets and conclude on the Statistics. 

# Step 1: Collecting the Datasets
As of September 2018, There were approximately 2 Million iOS Apps available on the App Store and 2.1 Million Android apps on the Google Play.
There are Two Data sets which are available and will be used in the Project:
• A data set containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018.
• A data set containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2018

# Step 2: Data Scrubbing
I deleted unwanted Apps which were focused on languages other than English, inaccurate data and multiple entries of the same App.

# Step 3: Analysis
I analysed the datasets based on the various Categories available and the review ratings for each.Then I further analysed  based on the top Category with the less numbr of Apps comparitively.

# Step 4: Conclusion
I concluded that coming up with a Reading App having various Features like Discussion forums, virtual meetups, etc. would be a good idea.
For now, developing the App for the Googleplay Store would be a a good idea and after monitoring the insights for about three months and then developing an App for the iOS Store would be better.
